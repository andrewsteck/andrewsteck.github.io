## Computer Code

I use a variety of software for my research.  Sometimes that research involves writing code to solve computational challenges.

From time to time, I may post and document bits of code I have written (or public code I have found) to tackle a given problem.  This page is intended primarily for self-reference, but may serve as a resource for interested users.  Any code should be used at your own risk.

For current public repositories, you can also visit [my github page](http://github.com/andrewsteck).
