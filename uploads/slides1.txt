Text: 

- no phones, laptops or tablets
- browsing is too tempting!
- hurts own and other learning

# Slide(24):

Header: Course Overview

Title: Course Philosophy

Text:

In this course we will focus on **timeless** and **fundamental** truths.

We will use historical examples and anecdotes to build intuition.

We will also use **economic models** to clarify our thinking and illuminate tradeoffs.

NB that this approach will require some use of formal math (calculus + algebra), though we will try not to get lost in the mathematical weeds.

# Slide(25):

Header: Shapiro & Varian Chapter 1

Title: Information

Text:

*Information* is costly to produce, but cheap to reproduce.  I.e. these industries are characterised by high fixed costs and low marginal costs.

Consumer valuations vary widely, making *price discrimination* an attractive possibility.  This can include the use of versioning and/or delay, and will require IP management.

# Slide(26):

Header: Shapiro & Varian Chapter 1

Title: Information

Text:

*Information* is often an *experience good*; successfully selling it can require free trials / samples and/or careful management of reputation.  *Rights management* is key to pulling this off.

Economics of attention emerging as this book was written.  The attention + targeted ad model has been extremely successful (financially).

# Slide(27):

Header: Shapiro & Varian Chapter 1

Title: Technology

Text:

Information cannot be economically separated from the *technical systems* it relies on for dispersion and use.

High degrees of vertical disintegration means firms must pay close attention to systems and opportunities for collaboration (as well as competition).

# Slide(28):

Header: Shapiro & Varian Chapter 1

Title: Technology

Text:

High fixed costs of technology can lead to *lock-in*, as *switching costs* may be too high to prevent switching to new or better technologies.

Of course whether this is good or bad depends on your perspective!

*Network effects* and *platforms* are more prevalent today than ever; these increase the importance of *timing*, forming consumer and rival *expectations* and the decision to independently or cooperatively form *standards*.

# Slide(29):

Header: Shapiro & Varian Chapter 1

Title: Policy

Text:

How does regulatory policy need to change given the realities of the information economy?

Antitrust legislation typically written decades (or centuries) ago, and relies on prices to determine harm.

Given the ubiquity and importance of modern information platforms and systems, are there new questions of national security and/or sovereignty that need to be addressed?

# Slide(30):

Header: Shapiro & Varian Chapter 1

Title: Approach

Text:

This book is concerned with **models**, **concepts**, and **analysis**.

As opposed to **trends**, **vocabulary**, and **analogies**.

# Slide(31):

Header: Economics Review

Title: Review of Basic Economic Concepts

Text:

Now we'll review a few basic economic concepts that we'll need for the remainder of the course:

- Nash Equilibrium & Game Theory

- Games in Matrix-Form and Tree-Form

- Competition in Prices (Bertrand) and Quantities (Cournot)
