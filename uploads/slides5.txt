BigText: Class 5 - Lock-In

Text: Oct 1st

# Slide(2):

Today's Agenda:

1. Overview of Shapiro & Varian Chapter 5
2. Tie-in to other pricing strategies
3. Economic Models of Lock-in

# Slide(3):

Text: "Buyers typically must bear costs when they switch from one information system to another.  Understanding these costs of switching technologies...is fundamental to success in today's economy."

Why?

SpeakerNote: compare buying a new car to a new phone; durable investments in complementary assets; switching costs = lock-in

# Slide(5):

Text: In 1980s, Bell Atlantic purchased AT&T 5ESS switches for $3b; useful life of 15 years.  

Problem: AT&T now has monopoly power over Bell for system upgrades

SpeakerNote: AT&T can sell software for $10m a pop (voice recognition, 888 recognition); after-market upgrades account for 30-40% of annual revenue; Bell sued AT&T in 1995 for monopolization.

# Slide(6):

Text: Lock-in is strategically valuable even when switching costs are much smaller.

1m customers with switching costs of $100 = 1 customer with switching costs of $100m

# Slide(8):

Text: Switching costs offer a reprieve from harsh Bertrand Competition.

NPV of customer = total switching cost.

SpeakerNote:  numerical example here.

# Slide(11):

Title: Durable Purchases

Text: 
- lock-in falls as equipment depreciates
- if complementary assets, lock-in is sum of parts
- *offer early upgrades to maximise lock-in!*

# Slide(13):

Text: NB that high-tech lock-in tends to be more durable than low-tech.

Durable equipment purchases wear out, but specialised databases live and grow!

# Slide(14):

Title: Brand-Specific Training

Text: 
- re-training personnel is costly
- (+ opportunity cost)
- tends to rise over time as expertise grows

# Slide(15):

Title: Information & Databases

Text: 
- big switching costs when new formats appear (VHS to DVD)
- lower (but non-zero!) for purely digital formats
- 'open interfaces' a good option for buyers

# Slide(16):

Title: Specialised Suppliers

Text: 
- DoD procurement
- IBM + Intel vs AMD
- 'bad' in short-run, very good in long-run!

# Slide(17):

Title: Search Costs

Text: 
- have fallen in digital age
- still costly for customers to review and evaluate proposals
- can be counteracted by price obfuscation (more below)

# Slide(18):

Title: Loyalty Programs

Text: 
- ubiquitous (coffee to airlines)
- two-part cost (lost benefits + tiers of service)

# Slide(19):

"As on-line commerce explodes, more and more companies will adopt loyalty programs giving preferential treatment to customers based on their historical purchases precisely to create such switching costs."
